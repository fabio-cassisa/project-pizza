# Javascript Pizzeria

Technigo JS/React Course project ONE: Javascript Pizzeria, Fabio Cassisa. 
In this project the main focus is to play around with the variables, using simple logic, in order to create a chain of prompt/alert that emulate an online ordering process for a restaurant.

Focusing on vanilla JS, the idea is to have a solid program where the user inputs different data and get their order ready to go.

## The problem

I tried to follow what the steps asked me to do having in mind to come up with something that could be solid. To do so, I tried to be as DRY as possible and to add some conditionals to prevent the program break if the user would click "cancel" or not enter some sort of data when required.
